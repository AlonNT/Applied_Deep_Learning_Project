# Applied Deep Learning Course Project: Learn the best color space for classification tasks
Image classification is typically done in RGB space. 
Some papers found that different color spaces achieve better performance on some tasks. 
This project will try to learn the best color space for different classification tasks, by directly learning a per-color embedding. 
This will settle the question of the best color space.
